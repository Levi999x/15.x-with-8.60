# 15.x-with-8.60

Hi,

I've downgraded the 15.x assets to 8.60 DAT and SPR using SpiderClientConverter. I've added all original 8.60 outfits, items, and effects.
This gives you a complete 8.60 client with content from versions up to 15.x.
I converted every single item from 8.60 by hand from asynchronous to synchronous. This means idle animations for outfits now work perfect and we don't have any bugs or visual glitches in the animation
This branch works with CIP Client
